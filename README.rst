Cloudmesh extdocker
==============

An dynamically extensible CMD5 based command shell to manager single docker instances and also docker swarm

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7.13

WARNING
-------

WE HAVE NOT YET BUILD IN AUTHENTICATION INTO THE FRAMEWORK, SO RUNNING THIS IS INSECURE

Installation from source
------------------------

Setup a virtualenv either with virtualenv or pyenv.

virtualenv::

    virtualenv ~/ENV2

pyenv::

    pyenev virtualenv 2.7.13 ENV2

Now you need to get two source directories. We assume yo place them in
~/github::

    mkdir ~/github
    cd ~/github
    git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.common.git
    git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.cmd5.git
    git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.docker.git

The cmd5 repository contains the shell, while the cloudmesh.docker directory
contains the commands docker and swarm.

To install them simply to the following::

    cd ~/github/cloudmesh.common
    python setup.py install; pip install -e .
    cd ~/github/cloudmesh.cmd5
    python setup.py install; pip install -e .
    cd ~/github/cloudmesh.docker
    python setup.py install; pip install -e

Execution
---------

to run the shell you can activate it with the cms command. cms stands
for cloudmesh shell::

    (ENV2) $ cms

It will print the banner and enter the shell::

CMD5 configuration
------------------

To configure access to docker on a machine please use the cloudmesh_cmd5.yaml file

You will have to do the following modifications:

PLEASE FILL IN TEH DETAILS


Docker Api
----------

The CMD5 docker and swarm commands can be used to work on docker 
installed on any server. The only requirement is to have docker api
exposed out in a certain port.

As part of the project we are also building a dockerfile which will
contain a docker image with setup files for installing docker on 
remote VM using ansible.(This is currently WIP)

Once docker is installed please ensure that the DOCKER_OPTS
value is set in the docker file in /etc/default as below::

    DOCKER_OPTS="-H unix:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:3243"

Setting the above value and restarting the docker service will ensure 
docker api is exposed and accessible remotely.


Steps to execute
----------------
Below are example usage of the command.The first step is always to
set the docker api url::

    cms> docker api http://x.x.x.x:4243

    cms> docker image list

    cms> docker container list
    Name            Image           Status
    reverent_cray           ubuntu:latest           created
    suspicious_bhabha               ubuntu:latest           created
    condescending_feynman           ubuntu:latest           exited
    infallible_hodgkin              ubuntu:latest           exited
    gigantic_noyce          ubuntu:latest           exited
    berserk_hugle           ubuntu:latest           exited
    tiny_franklin           ubuntu:latest           exited
    modest_volhard          ubuntu:latest           created
    condescending_heyrovsky         ubuntu:latest           exited
    sad_mccarthy            ubuntu          exited

Unit Tests
----------

We are providing a simple set of tests that verify the integration of docker
into cloudmesh. They can either be run with `nosetests` or `py.test`.

Use::

  py.test

to check them out and see if the tests succeed.
